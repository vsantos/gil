	Use:   "gil",
	Short: "Get estimated node costs based on CPU/Mem requests",
	Long: `Gil is a binary that allows to retrieve your deployments estimated costs
based on it's CPU and Memory requests using label-selector as filter. With this
information gil is able to calculate the percent of usage from it's pods within a
node. The method of calculation is very simple and not covers limits or fluctuations.

You can also retrieve individual pod costs along with it's deployment by '--show-labels'

The only supported provider for now is 'AWS'. Which means the Gil is only able to estimate
costs from pods running within ec2 instances.`,
